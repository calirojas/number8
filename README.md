# Number8

## API
No time to implement holidays in the months. The method exists in the jQuery object.
If you want to use it from the JavaScript console, type: $.numberEightCalendar.getHolidays(2017)

The key used returns dummy data. I'm using the testing key to avoid bandwidth issues (looks like
the free version accepts only 500 requests by month).

The key could be replaced in js/calendar.js : HOLIDAYS_API.KEY

## Errors
There's a problem (counting the days) with the example received. Please, see the image:
