## API
No time to implement holidays in the months. The method exists in the jQuery object.
If you want to use it from the JavaScript console, type: $.numberEightCalendar.getHolidays(2017)

The key used returns dummy data. I'm using the testing key to avoid bandwidth issues (looks like
the free version accepts only 500 request by month).

The key could be replaced in js/calendar.js : HOLIDAYS_API.KEY
