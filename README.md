## API
No time to implement holidays in the months. The method exists in the jQuery object.
If you want to use it from the JavaScript console, type: $.numberEightCalendar.getHolidays(2017)

The key used returns dummy data. I'm using the public key. It could be
replaced in js/calendar.js : HOLIDAYS_API.KEY
